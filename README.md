# SVG <use> Element and Symbol Definitions

## Define "Icon Library" - from [IconLibraryExample](https://github.com/alexanderweigelt/IconLibraryExample)

An icon library is a collection of reusable icons that are commonly used in web development and design. These icons are typically created as vector graphics in formats like SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and are organized and stored for easy access and use in web projects. Icon libraries serve several important purposes in web development:

1. **Consistency:** Icon libraries ensure that icons used throughout a website or web application are consistent in style, size, and appearance. This consistency helps create a cohesive and professional user interface.

2. **Efficiency:** Instead of designing or searching for icons individually for each project, developers and designers can rely on an icon library to provide a wide range of pre-designed icons. This saves time and effort in the design and development process.

3. **Scalability:** Icons in a library are typically vector-based, which means they can be scaled to different sizes without losing quality. This is crucial for responsive design, where icons may need to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions.

4. **Reduced File Size:** When icons are included in a library, they can be optimized for performance. Icons can be bundled together, reducing the number of HTTP requests and file sizes, which can improve page load times.

5. **Ease of Maintenance:** Managing icons in a centralized library makes it easier to update, modify, or expand the collection. If a design change or additional icons are needed, it can be done in one place and reflected across the entire project.

6. **Customization:** Many icon libraries provide options to customize the color or style of icons through CSS or other methods, allowing designers to tailor icons to match a project's branding or design requirements.

7. **Accessibility:** Icon libraries can include accessibility features like aria-labels and titles, ensuring that screen readers and other assistive technologies can properly interpret and convey the meaning of the icons to users with disabilities.

8. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Icons in a library can be tested and optimized for cross-browser compatibility, ensuring they render correctly in various web browsers.

In summary, an icon library is a valuable resource for web development, simplifying the process of including consistent, scalable, and customizable icons in web projects while optimizing performance and accessibility.

Our library was bilt using `SVG <use> Element and Symbol Definitions`

This approach uses the SVG `<use>` element to reference symbols defined within an SVG sprite. It's a method often used for icon libraries because it allows for easy reusing and styling of icons.

Pros:

- Lightweight and efficient as icons are defined in a single SVG sprite.
  Supports CSS styling of individual icons.
- Easy to maintain and extend.

Cons:

- Limited interactivity (e.g., hover effects) with JavaScript compared to inline SVGs.

## React with Vite

Minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
